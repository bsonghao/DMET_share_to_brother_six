# DMET for quantum chemistry

In this project, we seek to implement the density matrix embedding theory (DMET) method described in Wouters, Sebastian, et al. "A practical guide to density matrix embedding theory in quantum chemistry." Journal of chemical theory and computation 12.6 (2016): 2706-2719.
